# What is this?

This is a very simple React app showcasing the usage of a context API with a mixture of using standard React classes and React hooks.

There is no styling other than creating div borders, showing how sibling or nested child components can grab from the "global State" variable.
In turn, it should handle both synchronous and asynchronous calls.  We take advantage of React Hook lifecycles to update and render to the UI a list of github repositories based on the username we're looking up.

Latest releases of React really shows depending on the scaleable size of the app, we can forego the usage and overhead cost of using Redux via the context API.

Go ahead, give it a shake!
